# Manage-Library
Offline library management project in C# language in Visual Studio environment
Library management project without the use of a database and with the storage method in a text file.
tip:
When opening the zip file, the Manage-Library folder should be placed in the following path:
C:\Users\sajad\source\repos
Instead of users and Sajjad's name, the details of his computer should be placed.
I hope you enjoy the project and don't forget the star.
